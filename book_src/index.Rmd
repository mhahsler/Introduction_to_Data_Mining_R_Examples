This book contains documented R examples to accompany several chapters
of the popular data mining textbook [*Introduction to Data
Mining*](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/) by Pang-Ning
Tan, Michael Steinbach, Anuj Karpatne and Vipin Kumar. The companion
book can be used with either edition: 1st edition [@Tan2005] or 2nd
edition [@Tan2018].

The code examples collected in this book were developed for the course
[CS 7331 - Data Mining](http://michael.hahsler.net/SMU/CS7331) taught
at [SMU](http://www.smu.edu) since Spring 2013 and will be regularly
updated and improved. 
The learning method used in this book is learning-by-doing. 
The code examples throughout this book are
written in a self-contained manner so you can copy-and-paste a portion of the code,
try it out on the provided dataset and then apply it directly to your own 
data.

The latest update includes the use of the popular
packages in the meta-package `tidyverse` [@R-tidyverse] including
`ggplot2` [@R-ggplot2] for data wrangling and visualization along with
`caret` [@R-caret] for model building and evaluation. 
Presentation slides and other instructor resources are available on the
[book's GitHub page.](https://github.com/mhahsler/Introduction_to_Data_Mining_R_Examples)

I hope this book helps you to learn to use R more efficiently for your
data mining projects.
