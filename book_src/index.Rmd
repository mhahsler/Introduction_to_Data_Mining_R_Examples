# Preface {.unnumbered}

This companion book contains documented R examples to accompany several chapters
of the popular data mining textbook [*Introduction to Data
Mining*](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/) by Pang-Ning
Tan, Michael Steinbach, Anuj Karpatne and Vipin Kumar. 
It is not intended as a replacement for the textbook since it does not cover the 
theory, but as a guide accompanying the textbook.
The companion
book can be used with either edition: 1st edition [@Tan2005] or 2nd
edition [@Tan2018]. The sections are numbered to match the 2nd edition. Sections
marked with an asterisk are additional content that is not covered in 
the textbook.

The code examples collected in this book were developed for the course
_CS 5/7331 Data Mining_ taught 
at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level
at the [Computer Science Department](https://www.smu.edu/lyle/departments/cs) at
Southern Methodist University (SMU) since Spring 2013 and will be regularly
updated and improved. 
The learning method used in this book is learning-by-doing. 
The code examples throughout this book are
written in a self-contained manner so you can copy and paste a portion of the code,
try it out on the provided dataset and then apply it directly to your own 
data. Instructors can use this companion as a component to create an 
introduction to data mining course for advanced undergraduates and graduate
students who are proficient in programming and have basic statistics knowledge.
The latest version of this book (html and PDF) 
with a complete set of lecture slides (PDF and PowerPoint) 
is provided on the
[book's GitHub page.](https://github.com/mhahsler/Introduction_to_Data_Mining_R_Examples)

The latest update includes the use of the popular
packages in the meta-package `tidyverse` [@R-tidyverse] including
`ggplot2` [@R-ggplot2] for data wrangling and visualization, along with
`caret` [@R-caret] for model building and evaluation. 
Please use the edit function within this book or visit the [book's
GitHub project
page](https://github.com/mhahsler/Introduction_to_Data_Mining_R_Examples)
to submit corrections or suggest improvements.

data mining projects.
